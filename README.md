Here are my solutions to the exercises from the "Computer Programming" course, taken during the first semester at the School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, National Technical University of Athens.

While a few solutions are still missing, they will be added shortly.

Although some solutions might not be optimized for complexity, they successfully pass all test cases on Grader.

I welcome any corrections for mistakes or suggestions for optimizations to improve these files!
